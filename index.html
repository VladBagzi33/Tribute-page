                <p>"There are several legends. According to one, Emperor Dušan was never canonized for organizing the brutal murder of his father, King Dečanski. In other legends, it is claimed that before the outbreak of the plague, he fled to Hilandar with his wife Jelena. After exhaustive persuasion, the elders of the monastery barely agreed to allow Princess Jelena Stracimirović Nemanjić to set foot on the holy ground, thus setting a precedent. There is also a legend according to which it is claimed that Emperor Dušan did not become a saint because of excessive cooperation with Catholics."</p>
